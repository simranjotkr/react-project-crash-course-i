- I learnt about useEffect() Hook in React while developing the funtionality of Add Contact button.
- Passing functions as props from paremt component to child component was bit tricky and needs more practice but we will get more of it.
- Learnt that we can use async attribute with link tag to ensure that html keeps loading simultaneously while the external resource is being loaded.
- Using Semantic UI to create seamless UI elements, "ui button", "ui menu", "ui container" etc.
- I learnt about localStorage, how to set and get item from it so that even on refresh the data persists.
